# pgh_tech
Creating metrics to rank tech meetup groups in Pittsburgh by popularity

# The Datasets:
***The main datasets in this project were gathered on Jan 23, 2018 and Jan 27, 2018 using my custom python script to make requests to the meetup.com API***

- "pgh\_meetup\_groups\_Jan\_27\_2018.csv" contains the main data used in the updated analysis.
- "last\_five\_rsvp\_means.csv" contains the mean RSVP counts for the previous 5 events for all tech groups in Pittsburgh. Date generated: Jan 27, 2018

- OUTDATED: "pgh\_meetup\_groups\_Jan\_23\_2018.csv" was used in the original analysis were recent RSVP was used instead of the mean.  I've kept it here just in case it proves useful.
